# smallfish-database
## Overview
- Python scripts are designed to clean, process, and validate data to be loaded into a small-bodied fish database for the Upper Colorado Endangered Fish Recovery Program.
- This work streamlines the data prep and cleaning process for up to 10 different projects spanning 40+ years of sampling and includes tens of thousands of fish, habitat, and environmental data points.
- The cleaned data and database facilitates query and look up abilities for native aquatic biologists working on endangered species recovery.
